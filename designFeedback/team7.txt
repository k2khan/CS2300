1./ I like that the rules and overview was presented well, as im sure most people have not seen this game before. I also like the fact that our game is different than most the other games.

2./ In the design, we can definitely give more detail. For example, we should should give specific costs for wire and autoclippers, how demand is calculated, how the price fluctuates, and more.

3./ I don't have any critiques for the presentation.
